🏏 IPL Data Analysis – Ball-by-Ball Insights

This project analyzes ball-by-ball IPL cricket data to uncover meaningful batting, bowling, and match insights using Python, Matplotlib, and Power BI. The goal is to transform raw data into actionable insights and interactive dashboards that showcase the power of data-driven storytelling in sports analytics.

📌 Objectives

Clean and preprocess raw IPL ball-by-ball dataset.

Extract player-level insights (batting and bowling performance).

Generate match-level insights (runs, wickets, extras, partnerships).

Visualize findings using Matplotlib and Power BI.

Build an interactive dashboard for dynamic exploration.

🔧 Tech Stack

Python → Pandas (data wrangling), Matplotlib (visualization).

Excel → Exporting structured datasets for Power BI.

Power BI → Interactive dashboard for insights exploration.
